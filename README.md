## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SaifAlvi0/Ceaser-cipher-tool.git
cd Ceaser-cipher-tool
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install required libraries

This tool requires **Tkinter**.  
Tkinter is included with most standard Python installations. If you need to install it manually, use:

- **For Debian/Ubuntu/Linux:**
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```

- **For macOS (usually pre-installed):**
  If not available:
  ```sh
  brew install python-tk
  ```

- **For Windows:**  
  Tkinter is included by default with the official Python installer from python.org.

## üß© How Caesar Cipher Works

The Caesar cipher is a classic substitution cipher in which each letter of the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number down the alphabet.  
For example, with a shift of 3:  
- "A" becomes "D"
- "B" becomes "E", etc.

Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, numbers, punctuation) remain unchanged.
